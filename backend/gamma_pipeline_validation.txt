Gamma Embedding Pipeline Validation Test

System Architecture Validation
This document serves as the final validation test for the complete local Gamma embedding pipeline implementation in Streamworks RAG MVP. The system has been enhanced with critical dependency fixes and configuration optimizations.

Local Gamma Model Integration
The LocalGammaEmbedder class successfully initializes the nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5 model with automatic device detection supporting MPS (Apple Silicon), CUDA (NVIDIA), and CPU fallback configurations. The trust_remote_code parameter has been properly configured to allow custom model execution.

Dependency Resolution
Critical issues have been resolved including NumPy compatibility (downgraded to 1.26.4), DocumentChunk section attribute mapping (fixed section_name reference), and einops tensor operations library installation. These fixes ensure seamless operation of the complete pipeline.

ChromaDB Vector Storage
The vector database integration supports dynamic embedding dimensions and provides efficient semantic search capabilities. The system can handle both local Gamma embeddings and OpenAI embeddings with provider-specific metadata tracking.

Processing Pipeline Stages
1. Document upload with WebSocket progress tracking
2. Docling content analysis and structure recognition  
3. Intelligent text chunking with LangChain splitters
4. Local Gamma embedding generation with batch processing
5. ChromaDB vector storage with comprehensive metadata
6. Real-time status updates throughout the workflow

Expected Validation Results
This test document should successfully demonstrate the end-to-end pipeline functionality including local embedding generation, proper vector storage, and semantic search readiness without external API dependencies. The system maintains complete data privacy while providing enterprise-grade document processing capabilities.

Performance Optimization Features
Batch processing with configurable sizes, memory-efficient tensor operations, and device-optimized computation ensure optimal performance across different hardware configurations while maintaining processing quality and speed.
