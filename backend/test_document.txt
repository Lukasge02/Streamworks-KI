Test Document for Local Gamma Embedding Pipeline

Introduction
This is a comprehensive test document designed to evaluate the complete document processing pipeline with local Gamma embeddings. The document contains multiple sections to ensure proper chunking and embedding generation.

Section 1: Technology Overview
Streamworks RAG MVP integrates advanced document processing capabilities with local embedding generation. The system uses Docling for intelligent document analysis and local Gamma models for embedding creation, eliminating the need for external API dependencies.

Section 2: Embedding Process
The embedding pipeline consists of several stages:
1. Document upload and validation
2. Docling analysis for content extraction
3. Intelligent chunking using LangChain text splitters
4. Local Gamma embedding generation using nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5
5. Vector storage in ChromaDB for semantic search

Section 3: Technical Implementation
The LocalGammaEmbedder class provides:
- Automatic device detection (MPS/CUDA/CPU)
- Batch processing for efficient embedding generation
- Support for multiple embedding dimensions
- Integration with ChromaDB vector database

Section 4: Quality Assurance
Each document chunk undergoes quality checks:
- Minimum content length validation
- Word count requirements
- Metadata enrichment with source information
- Automatic progress tracking through WebSocket connections

Section 5: Testing Objectives
This test document will verify:
- Successful document processing through all pipeline stages
- Generation of local Gamma embeddings without OpenAI API
- Proper storage in ChromaDB with correct metadata
- Real-time progress updates via WebSocket communication
- Complete integration between frontend and backend systems

Conclusion
The successful processing of this document will demonstrate the complete functionality of the local embedding pipeline, providing evidence that the system can operate independently of external APIs while maintaining high-quality document analysis and vector search capabilities.
