EmbeddingGemma Test Document
============================

This is a test document to verify that Google's EmbeddingGemma model is working correctly.

Key Features of EmbeddingGemma:
- 308M parameters for efficient on-device deployment
- 768-dimensional embeddings with Matryoshka Representation Learning
- State-of-the-art performance on MTEB benchmark
- Support for over 100 languages
- Optimized for RAG and semantic search applications

Technical Specifications:
- Model: google/embeddinggemma-300m
- Context Length: 2048 tokens
- Embedding Dimensions: 768 (with MRL support for 512/256/128)
- Architecture: Based on Gemma3 transformers with bi-directional attention

This test verifies the complete pipeline:
1. Document upload and processing
2. Chunking with Docling
3. Embedding generation using EmbeddingGemma
4. Vector storage in ChromaDB
5. End-to-end RAG pipeline functionality
