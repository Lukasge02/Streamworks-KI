Final Gamma Embedding Pipeline Test

System Validation Complete
This document represents the final validation test for the Streamworks RAG MVP local embedding pipeline after resolving all technical dependencies and configuration issues.

Technical Architecture Summary
The system successfully integrates the nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5 model for local embedding generation, ChromaDB for vector storage, and Docling for intelligent document processing. All components work together to provide enterprise-grade document management without external API dependencies.

Dependency Resolution Complete
All critical issues have been resolved:
- NumPy compatibility fixed with version 1.26.4
- DocumentChunk attribute mapping corrected for section_name
- trust_remote_code parameter properly configured for custom model execution
- einops tensor operations library installed and available

Pipeline Stages Verified
1. Document upload with hash-based deduplication
2. Docling content analysis with MPS device acceleration
3. Intelligent chunking with layout-aware metadata
4. Local Gamma embedding generation with batch processing
5. ChromaDB vector database integration with dynamic dimensions
6. Real-time WebSocket progress tracking throughout processing

Expected Outcome
This test should successfully demonstrate the complete end-to-end local embedding pipeline functionality, including successful model initialization, embedding generation, and ChromaDB vector storage integration, proving the system operates independently of external embedding services while maintaining high-quality semantic search capabilities.
