Final Local Gamma Embedding Pipeline Test

System Validation
This document serves as the final validation test for the complete local embedding pipeline with nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5 model and ChromaDB integration.

Architecture Overview
The Streamworks RAG MVP demonstrates enterprise-grade document processing capabilities with complete local embedding generation. The system eliminates external API dependencies while maintaining high-quality semantic search functionality.

Key Features Tested
1. Local Gamma embedding model initialization with trust_remote_code support
2. Automatic device detection and optimization (MPS/CUDA/CPU)
3. Document processing through Docling with intelligent chunking
4. ChromaDB vector database integration for semantic search
5. Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket connections
6. Complete pipeline orchestration without OpenAI dependencies

Expected Outcome
This test should successfully demonstrate the complete workflow from document upload to vector storage, proving that the local embedding pipeline provides production-ready document analysis capabilities with full data privacy and no external service requirements.
