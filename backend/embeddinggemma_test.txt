EmbeddingGemma Integration Test

This is a test document to verify that the EmbeddingGemma model (google/embeddinggemma-300m) is properly integrated and working.

Key points to test:
1. Model loading: The system should load google/embeddinggemma-300m instead of nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5
2. Encode methods: The system should use encode_document() for document embeddings and encode_query() for query embeddings
3. Dimensions: The embeddings should be 768-dimensional, compatible with ChromaDB
4. Performance: The model should process this document efficiently

Expected behavior:
- Docling processing should chunk this document
- EmbeddingGemma should create embeddings using the correct model
- ChromaDB should store the embeddings successfully
- Pipeline should complete without errors

This test verifies the complete RAG pipeline integration with EmbeddingGemma.
